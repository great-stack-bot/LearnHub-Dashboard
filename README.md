Overview
LearnHub-Dashboard is built to streamline the management of an online learning platform by combining a modern frontend with a robust backend. It leverages TypeScript, React, and Express to deliver a fast, scalable, and maintainable application. Shared data definitions ensure consistency, while in-memory storage simplifies development, with plans for a PostgreSQL database in production.
Features

Dynamic Dashboard: Displays key metrics like total teachers, students, and course enrollment with visual cards.
Course Management: Browse and view detailed course information using responsive, reusable UI components.
Client-Side Navigation: Smooth page transitions without full reloads for a fluid user experience.
Data Fetching: Efficiently retrieves and caches data using TanStack Query for fast performance.
Consistent UI: Reusable components ensure a polished and uniform look across the application.
Development-Friendly: In-memory storage and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) enable rapid iteration.
Scalable Design: Shared data schemas prepare the app for easy integration with a persistent database.

Tech Stack

Frontend:

React: For building interactive user interfaces.
TypeScript: Ensures type safety and reduces errors.
Shadcn/UI: Provides customizable, accessible UI components.
TanStack Query: Manages server-state data fetching and caching.
Wouter: Handles lightweight client-side routing.
Tailwind CSS: Enables utility-first styling for rapid UI development.
Framer Motion: Adds smooth animations to components.


Backend:

Express.js: Powers API endpoints for data communication.
Zod: Validates data for consistency and security.
Drizzle ORM: Defines database schemas for future production use.


Build Tools:

Vite: Provides fast development and optimized production builds.
ESBuild: Bundles backend code efficiently.


Data Storage:

In-Memory Storage (MemStorage): Temporary storage for development and testing.
PostgreSQL: Planned for persistent storage in production.



Project Architecture
The application follows a modular structure to ensure scalability and maintainability:

Shared Data Definitions (shared/schema.ts): Uses Zod and Drizzle ORM to define data structures for consistency across frontend and backend.
Client-Side Navigation: Wouter enables smooth, reload-free page transitions.
Reusable UI Blocks: Combines Shadcn/UI and custom components for a consistent UI.
Server State Management: TanStack Query handles data fetching, caching, and error states.
In-Memory Data Storage (server/storage.ts): Temporary storage for development, seeded with sample data.
Backend API Routes (server/routes.ts): Express.js endpoints for frontend-backend communication.
Application Shell Layout (client/src/components/layout/main-layout.tsx): Provides a consistent layout with a persistent sidebar and header.

Installation
To set up LearnHub-Dashboard locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LearnHub-Dashboard.git
cd LearnHub-Dashboard


Install Dependencies:
npm install


Run in Development Mode:
npm run dev

This starts the Vite development server with HMR, accessible at http://localhost:5000.

Build for Production:
npm run build

This generates optimized files in the dist folder.

Start the Production Server:
npm run start

This serves the optimized application from dist.


Usage

Development:

Use npm run dev to start the development server with live reloading.
Edit frontend files in client/src for instant UI updates via HMR.
Test API endpoints (e.g., /api/metrics, /api/courses) using tools like Postman or curl.


Data Management:

The MemStorage class (server/storage.ts) seeds sample data for courses, metrics, and more.
Data is validated using schemas in shared/schema.ts with Zod.


Production:

Run npm run build to create optimized assets.
Deploy the dist folder to a web server and use npm run start to serve the application.
